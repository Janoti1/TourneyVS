Tourney Versus tries to adjust Versus mode to a degree that the community can hold tournaments.

[h1]Functionality[/h1]
You can pause the game by typing [b]/pause[/b] or by binding a keybind to it in the mod menu.
You can suicide as pactsworn by typing [b]/die[/b]

Note that this does not stop the game fully; this is to allow that chat messages can still be sent and received which should facilitate communication during pauses.
